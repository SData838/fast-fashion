    <section class="mb-5 text-center">
      <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
      <p>
        Fast fashion refers to the rapid production of inexpensive, trendy clothing that imitates current runway styles. Designed to be worn briefly and replaced quickly, it thrives on mass production, quick turnaround, and consumer demand.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5 text-center">
      <h2>SEEP Framework Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The SEEP framework analyses an issue through four lenses:
        <strong>Social, Economic, Environmental,</strong> and <strong>Political</strong>. It helps us understand not just the direct impacts of fast fashion, but also the deeper, systemic effects it has on society and the world.

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploitative labor practices:</strong> Garment workers in countries like Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam often work in unsafe, overcrowded factories for extremely low wages with no job security or legal protections.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsafe working conditions:</strong> Tragedies like the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 show the deadly consequences of poor regulation and neglect in the supply chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender inequality and child labor:</strong> Women and children form a large part of the labor force in garment factories, often without rights, benefits, or education opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer culture:</strong> Fast fashion reinforces shallow ideals where identity and worth are linked to appearance and clothing trends, fueling social pressure and compulsive buying behavior.</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/money-bag-euro.png" alt="Economic Icon" class="icon"/>
        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High profits through exploitation:</strong> Fast fashion brands benefit from extremely low production costs and high markups, maximizing profits at the expense of laborers.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-cost jobs:</strong> While the industry provides employment, jobs are often unstable, unregulated, and poorly paid, perpetuating cycles of poverty in supplier countries.</li>
        <li><strong>Overproduction and waste:</strong> Unsold inventory is often burned or landfilled, wasting resources and money. Consumers also waste money on clothes they discard quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Undermining local economies:</strong> Ethical and small-scale local textile producers struggle to compete with mass-produced, cheaper alternatives.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water usage:</strong> Cotton farming and textile dyeing use vast quantities of water. For example, a single T-shirt can require over 2,700 liters of water to produce.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Factories often dump toxic dyes and chemicals into rivers and water systems, contaminating ecosystems and harming local communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Textile waste:</strong> Approximately 92 million tonnes of clothing end up in landfills every year. Much of this waste is synthetic and non-biodegradable.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbon emissions:</strong> The fashion industry contributes about 10% of global COâ‚‚ emissions, exceeding the emissions of aviation and maritime shipping combined.</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/law.png" alt="Political Icon" class="icon"/>
        <h2>Political Impact</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak labor laws:</strong> Many supplier countries lack strong labor protections, allowing brands to operate with little oversight or accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Global trade policy:</strong> Trade agreements often prioritize economic growth over human rights or environmental protections, giving brands more flexibility and less responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of regulation:</strong> There is little global enforcement of sustainability or ethical standards in the fashion industry. Supply chains remain largely opaque.</li>
        <li><strong>Activism and advocacy:</strong> Political pressure is growing through global movements like Fashion Revolution, pushing for transparency, fair wages, and sustainable sourcing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Fast fashion may offer cheap and accessible clothing, but its true cost is paid by workers, the environment, and global equity. SEEP analysis reveals that while fast fashion is economically beneficial for large brands, it creates profound social and environmental damage, and is sustained by weak political systems. Awareness, advocacy, and ethical consumption are key steps toward change.
